The topic of this tutorial focuses on the cutting-edge algorithmic development in the area of recommender systems. This tutorial will provide an in depth picture of the progress of ranking models in the field, summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and discussing open issues that could be promising for future research in the community. A qualitative and quantitative comparison between different models will be provided while we will also highlight recent developments in the areas of Reinforcement Learning. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},
