\section*{Abstract}
Recommender systems are in high demand across various industries. Its results and effectiveness have been proven in e-commerce, entertainment, advertising, and many other business domains.
On the other hand, bringing a recommender system to market commonly faces data sparsity and cold start problems, which, further effects recommendation quality and sets a limit on predictions. 
Although lots of research effort has been devoted to developing algorithms in tackling the issues as mentioned above, we have not yet seen a framework that solves the data and model capacity challenges in a holistic approach.
In this research, we combine representation embedding and cross-domain transfer learning techniques on top of knowledge graph to form a unified framework. The framework enhances data and model prediction capability in an end-to-end schema. The result would significantly improve the recommendation model performance in sparse or foreign data conditions. 
The research aims to ease the barrier of launching recommender systems, hence promote its business adoption to a broader audience. 
This research is aim to answer the following questions:
1) How to represent users and items in a unified heterogeneous knowledge graph for improving data density?
2) How to improve recommender systems' adaptiveness on new and unseen data with knowledge graph embedding?
3) How to use knowledge graphs to transfer cross-domain knowledge for enhanced recommendation results?
Finally, research will conduct a recommender system case study to validate and proposed methods.
