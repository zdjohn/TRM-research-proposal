\section*{Abstract}
Recommender systems are in high demand across various industries. Its results and effectiveness have proven in different domains, such as e-commerce, entertainment, and advertising, etc.
Bringing a recommender system to market commonly faces data sparsity and cold start problems. The data quality and availability effects recommendation quality and sets limit on model predictability. Those limitations, subsequently, impacts the success of launching a real-world system. 
Although lots of research effort has been devoted to developing algorithms in tackling above mentioned issues. We have not yet seen a framework that solves the data and model capacity challenges in a holistic approach.
In this research, we combine representation embedding and cross-domain transfer learning techniques on top of knowledge graph to form a unified framework. The framework enhances data and model prediction capability in an end-to-end schema. The result would significantly improve the recommendation model performance in sparse or foreign data conditions. 
The research aims to ease the barrier of launching recommender systems, hence promote its business adoption to a broader audience. 
This research will involve the following parts: 1) We propose a knowledge graph based framework to combine both user/item interactions and side information. 2) A representation method in heterogeneous knowledge graph will be built for enhanced recommendation model training. 3)An extended recommendation method will be developed that allow the recommender system to be adaptive to unseen data points 4)A knowledge graph based transfer learning method will be introduced to further improve target domain data by sourcing external domain's richer datasets. 5) Finally, a recommender system case study to validate and test the above methods will be conducted.
